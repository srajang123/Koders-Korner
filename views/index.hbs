        In current scenario, there is a continuous competition among the candidates to become best. And aong industries to choose the best. They conduct various types of tests and competitions to hire the students. One of the best way for hiring is hackathons
        and Coding Contests. Good product based companies are having various criteria to hire students. But the algorithmic challenges and contests are at top of thise criteria. To tackle those coding challenge and interviews, one requires a lot
        of training and practice. As the proverb "Practice makes a mn perfect" says, we need to do continuous practice in order to improve ourselves. Various practice contests are necessary to observe and record our progress. In this regard, various
        competitive programmig webstites like codechef and codeforces play an important role. The contests held in these websited help us know where we stand.
